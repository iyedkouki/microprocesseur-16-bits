# 16-Bit Microprocessor Project

## Introduction

This repository hosts a 16-bit microprocessor designed and implemented in VHDL, offering a complete and functional architecture for educational and experimental purposes.

The design integrates essential components such as an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), registers (including an accumulator and instruction register), and a memory interface, all coded in VHDL for simulation and synthesis on FPGA platforms. The state machine manages critical control signals like memory chip select (memcs), read/write mode (RnW), accumulator load (acc_ld), and program counter load (pc_ld), ensuring precise instruction execution. This project serves as a valuable resource for students, hobbyists, and engineers looking to explore microprocessor design, digital systems, and hardware description languages through a hands-on, open-source implementation.
